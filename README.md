# Work Day Scheduler

## How to use this site:

Welcome to the work-day-scheduler, which makes life easier for busy people! Upon loading the page, you will find the current day at the top of the page. Beneath that will be 9 boxes, one each for 9am to 5pm, the typical workday hours. Each box is colored in a particular way: boxes of hours past are grey; the box of the current hour is red, and future hours are green. Each box can also take input, and once the input is added, the save button to the right of the box saves it for future use.

Have fun, and make sure to manage your time well!
